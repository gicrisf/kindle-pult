# Kindle-pult

Catapult your e-books to Kindle and other e-book readers.

Kindle-pult is open-source and released under GPL license. It's purpouse is
to make easier to send files from your desktop to your e-reader. The name
recall _Kindle_ just because I made the app with my Kindle in mind.

Kindle-pult is a full Rust/GTK graphical wrapper around Calibre CLI functions,
so it will not work without Calibre.
